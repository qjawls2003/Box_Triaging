Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR) / Collection

Objective: Enumerate Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE internal network (192.168.169.0/24) further. Identify path to ADMIN1 workstation. If successfully accessed, pivot from ADMIN1 to any discovered mail servers. Intelligence reporting suggests there are two operational mail servers in a separate internal network connected to ADMIN1.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. All scanning must be conducted through secure tunnels. Nmap and traceroute command(s) are authorized but unreliable and known to produce false positives. Secure Copy (scp) is the preferred method for file transfers <10MB. All secure hash functions are authorized with the exception of SHA-0 algorithm.

Credentials: engineer#::enshallah // caisson#::tread_depth // NOC_Admin#::5gftE8DCc8 // user#::P455w0rd **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers and various other devices to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. Windows Defender is assumed to be installed and enabled network wide on all Windows devices within Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with all Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) suites, to include Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit and Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

Target Section:

T1: 10.50.29.166
Hostname: EXT_RTR
IP: 10.50.29.166
OS: Linux v. unknown
Creds: engineer#::enshallah
Last Known SSH Port: 10123
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.

Hostname: STORAGE1
IP: 10.20.169.122
OS: Windows v. unknown
Creds: caisson#::tread_depth
Last Known SSH Port: 52203
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.

T3:
Hostname: Vyos1
IP: 10.20.169.238
OS: Vyos
Creds: NOC_Admin#::5gftE8DCc8
Last Known SSH Port: 52230
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.

T4:
Hostname: ADMIN1
IP: 192.168.169.43 
OS: CentOS 7
Creds: user#::P455w0rd
Last Known SSH Port: Request analyst input
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Test credentials via SSH masquerade. If successful, perform a device survey. Collect any files of interest. Conduct network discovery to locate any mail servers in the ADMIN1’s internal network. Network discovery will at a minimum consist of scanning to determine all potential target IP’s, OS’s, and SSH Ports.  SSH ports for the potential target devices in this network are usually in the 33000-33999 range. Redirect to any additional targets of interest.

Hostname: Unknown
IP: Unknown
OS: Unknown
Creds: Unknown
Last Known SSH Port: Unknown
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Test credentials supplied by analyst via SSH masquerade. If successful, perform a device survey. Locate email accounts and collect all emails contained therein. Conclude operation.
