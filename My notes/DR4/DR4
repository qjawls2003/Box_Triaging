2022-08-11
Start Time: 0900
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc#
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst#

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Enumerate Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE network further. Maneuver through network and survey end user hosts (T4-T7).

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Redirection will be conducted through ssh tunnels, iptables, or netsh tunnels. All firewall manipulation requires MC approval prior to execution. File download methods must receive MC approval prior to execution due to unknown administrative posture in this network. All secure hash functions are authorized with the exception of SHA-0 algorithm.

Credentials: student#::password# //  **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. Windows Defender is assumed to be installed and enabled network wide on all Windows devices within Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit.
