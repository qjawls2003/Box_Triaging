Start Time: 0900
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc1
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst1

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Configure koadic stagers on Listening Post (LP) to accept callbacks that follow the scheme of maneuver. Perform SSH masquerade to T1 and establish tunnels to catch callbacks from T2-T5. Conduct device surveys on T2-T5.

Tools/Techniques: SSH masquerades are only authorized to the  LP (10.50.36.214) and T1 (10.50.28.166). Further connections will be established via callbacks and secure tunnels. Only set up one tunnel at a time. Kill your listener after you're done with each target. The LP should be treated similar to your opstation, but in grey space. Notify Analyst once a stager is complete to initiate a callback. Notification will include the full trigger line generated by Koadic.

Variables for the koadic stager:

*** # = your student number ***
T2 RHP = #229 – Endpoint = may
T3 RHP = #228 – Endpoint = theforce
T4 RHP = #227 – Endpoint = bewith
T5 RHP = #226 – Endpoint = you

Stager: stager/js/mshta
Koadic is located in / on the LP. Do not move it.

Credentials: student#::password# // NOC_admin#::7XBPRzyKsUWBeI3puA

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. ‘sudo’ is mandatory and required to execute koadic within opsec considerations. SSH masquerades are only authorized to the LP (10.50.36.214) and T1 (10.50.28.166). Windows Defender is assumed to be installed and enabled network wide on all Windows devices within Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with all Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) suites, to include Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit and Microsoft Defender Antivirus. All student accounts logged in VIA ssh belong to you and all other students, they are pre approved to operate alongside. Due to the nature of Koadic, Operator is authorized to access all implanted targets from the same terminal screen. Due to the shared nature of the LP and in order to prevent overwriting other students’ sockets, ensure all sockets are named TX.#, (so T1 for Student 4 would be T1.4)

Target Section:

LP
Hostname: koa-lp
IP:  10.50.40.222
OS: CentOS7
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: 22
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: Koadic
Action: Perform SSH masquerade. Redirect to T1. After accessing and vetting T1 and preparing tunnels, you will configure Koadic stagers one at a time.

The Koadic RAT is located in the system root directory (You must “cd” to this directory for Koadic to run properly) and requires sudo to function correctly. Configure Koadic stager variables as directed. Notify Analyst once a stager is complete to initiate callback.
