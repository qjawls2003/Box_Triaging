Start Time: 0900
Duration: 6 hours
MC: <MC>
Operator: student#
Analyst: <analyst>

Type of Operation: Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) // Offensive Cyber Operation (OCO)

Objective: Confirm health and status of all previously accessed targets. Intelligence reports suggest T9 (129.168.169.186) is a new, unidentified admin workstation and T10 (10.20.169.121) is the network web server. Once connected and confirmed on the correct target web server, deliver the approved cyber effect to deny port #80 traffic.

Tools/Techniques:  All connections will be established through SSH masquerades or netcat connections. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Secure Copy (scp) is the preferred method for file transfers <10MB. All secure hash functions are authorized with the exception of SHA-0 algorithm. Iptable configuration is authorized on target 8 for the duration of the connection to target9. Iptable configuration is authorized on the web server ONLY for a period of time determined by the MC and in coordination with TASK FORCE ALPHA (MC is in contact with their representative).

Credentials: engineer#::enshallah // caisson#::tread_depth // NOC_Admin#::AhmdLxu29D // askar#::DaXedayLasarah // **administrators documented to frequently implement default creds on internal routers and various other devices to enable incident response outsourcing

Prior Approvals: sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with all Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) suites, to include Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit and Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Analysts on operation will make analytical judgment based off of their target knowledge when providing credentials to test. Only three sets of credentials can be tested per target.

Iptable modification is approved as configured below and ONLY for the confirmed web server:

iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport #80 -j REJECT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport #80 -j REJECT

Verification with MC prior to delivery is required. Removing rules will also be directed by the MC.
