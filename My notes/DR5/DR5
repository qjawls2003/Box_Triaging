Start Time: 0900
Duration: 6 hours
MC: mc#
Operator: student#
Analyst: analyst#

Type of Operation: TECHOP // Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective: Conduct TECHOP on T1. If successful, continue mission: Perform access assurance on Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE network administrator workstations. For initial access targets (T8-T10),  perform device surveys.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through SSH masquerades. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change.

Credentials: student#::password#

Prior Approvals: TECHOP will be conducted as outlined in T1 action section. Hashes of any cleaned logs MUST be verified with the MC. Sudo is authorized for use sparingly at operator discretion unless otherwise instructed. Windows Defender is assumed to be installed and enabled network wide on all Windows devices within Krasnovian 1st Artillery BDE. MD has blanket approved operating and coexisting with Windows Defender enabled up to v. 10 /8.1 32-bit/64-bit.

Target Section:

T1 >>Entry Router<<
Hostname: EXT_RTR
IP: 10.50.27.188//10.145.117.86
MAC: fa:16:3e:91:7a:88
OS: CentOS7
Creds: student#::password#
Last Known SSH Port: 22011
Security Product(s): Unknown
Malware: Unknown
Implant: None
Action: Perform SSH masquerade and device vetting. Conduct TECHOP (see below) and once complete, maneuver to the next target.
TECHOP:
The previous operator left artifacts (log entries) on T1 and they must be cleaned prior to any further action. Modify the secure and messages logs to remove entries meeting the below requirements. Logs were generated during DR3 on 10AUG2022. You may consult previous opnotes to identify access and disconnect times, though we know they should have occurred between 1200 and 2100 target time. You will remove logs for student# and only student# and only for that time frame. You will save your copies in /tmp as [secure|messages].# and [secure|messages].#.clean. Once your files have been cleaned, you will report to the MC who will have a senior verify the clean logs and replace the existing logs. You will not overwrite the existing logs. Once you have the all clear, you will delete your temporary log files.
